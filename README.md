# RSG Chess APIs

RSG Chess and the RSG Chess APIs are part of our growing chess platform for developers and chess players.
We want everyone to be able to build chess experiences in hours instead of days and days instead of months.

**No matter if you're building chess game, chess analytics app, or even chess community blog RSG Chess' APIs
can help you with smart solutions, and your users - with great experience and performance!**

The chess programming, especially for the web is something that can become really better.
Even when we have powerful libraries such as [Chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/) and [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/) they're not
enough powerful for more complex chess developmnt. And also the best chess engines on the web are close-sourced.
_**We want to CHANGE THAT!**_ And we can! "`RSG Chess API`" is collection of open source solutions for every chess experience.

## What the `RSG Chess API` can do?
- Board managment, piece movement, checkmate/stalemate detection. Available on [NPM as `rsg-chess`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsg-chess). <br/>
- - Extended support: Our core APIs are available on the web (using `JS`/`ES` 5-7), on the servers running NodeJS,
on serverless back-ends, such as the Google Cloud Functions and on frameworks for building mobile apps, such as
ReactNative, NativeScript, Cordova, IONIC and much more
- Experimental AI - Simple AI that returns the best valid move using `minimax` algorythm.
- Great looking but simple to develop chess graphics based on basic HTML5 tables and CSS grids.
- - Chess graphics for the web using [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org) -
[`NPM/rsg-chess-graphics`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsg-chess-graphics).
- - Chess graphics for native mobile development using [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) or
[IONIC](https://ionicframework.com/) - [`NPM/rsg-chess-rn-graphics`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/rsg-chess-rn-graphics).
- Solutions for complex situations and tasks, such as transfering data to backends, using threads and workers.
- - methods to improve the performance and speed of your chess app.
- Easy methods to integrate third party chess libraries (such as `lichess api` or `Chess.js`) or your own functions.
